## Binary Classification: Building a Bankruptcy Predictor Through Random Forest Classification

Using a five-year dataset, I evaluated 

### Design


### Data

The data was sourced from UCI's [Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Polish+companies+bankruptcy+data), and was originally collected as part of a study through Poland's Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology. 

#### Preprocessing




### Algorithms

#### Feature Importance

<i>Models</i>

K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting classifiers were tested before random forest was determined to be the model with the most relevance for this business use case. 

Model Evaluation

### Tools

Scipy.io and pandas for data import and manipulation
Scikit-learn for modeling
Matplotlib for visualizations


### Communication

A confusion matrix and feature importance barchart were presented as part of a slide presentation:
